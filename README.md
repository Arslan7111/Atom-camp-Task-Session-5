1. Largest Difference in List
Problem: Given a list of integers, return the largest difference between any two elements, where the larger element appears after the smaller one. If no such pair exists, return 0.
Example: Input: [1, 2, 90, 10, 110] Output: 109 Explanation: The largest difference is between 1 and 110.
2. First Non-Repeating Character
Problem: Given a string, return the first non-repeating character. If there are no non-repeating characters, return None.
Example: Input: "aabcc" Output: 'b' Explanation: The first non-repeating character is 'b'.
3. Check If Strings Are Permutations
Problem: Given two strings, write a function to check if one is a permutation of the other. Return True if they are permutations, False otherwise.
Example: Input: "abc", "bca" Output: True Explanation: Both strings contain the same characters in any order.
4. Find the Second Largest Unique Number Mahnoor Salman

Problem: Given a list of integers, return the second largest unique number. If no second largest unique number exists, return None.
Example: Input: [4, 5, 6, 6, 7] Output: 6 Explanation: The second largest unique number is 6.
5. Count Distinct Pairs
Problem: Given a list of integers and a target sum, count how many distinct pairs of integers in the list sum up to the target.
Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 6], Target: 6 Output: 2 Explanation: The pairs (2, 4) and (1, 5) sum up to 6.
6. Remove Duplicates from List
Problem: Given a list of integers, remove all duplicates while maintaining the order of their first occurrence.
Example: Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Explanation: Duplicates are removed, but the order of elements is preserved.
7. Subsets of a List
Problem: Given a list of integers, return all possible subsets (the power set) of the list.
Example: Input: [1, 2, 3] Mahnoor Salman
atomcamp
Output: [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]] Explanation: The function returns all subsets of the list.
8. Longest Increasing Subsequence
Problem: Given a list of integers, find the length of the longest subsequence of strictly increasing elements.
Example: Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101].
9. Maximum Product of Two Numbers
Problem: Given a list of integers, return the maximum product of any two numbers in the list.
Example: Input: [1, 10, -5, 1, 100] Output: 1000 Explanation: The largest product comes from 10 * 100 = 1000.
10. Frequency of Characters in String
Problem: Given a string, return the character that appears most frequently. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically smallest character.
Example: Input: "aabbbc" Output: 'b' Explanation: The most frequent character is 'b'.
11. Print Prime Numbers Less Than N Mahnoor Salman

Problem: Write a function that prints all prime numbers less than a given number n.
Example: Input: 10 Output: 2, 3, 5, 7
12. Sum of Variable-Length Arguments
Problem: Write a function that takes a variable number of arguments (*args) and returns the sum of all the numbers.
Example: Input: (2, 3, 4) Output: 9 Explanation: The sum of 2 + 3 + 4 is 9.
13. Find the Student with Highest Score
Problem: Given a dictionary of students' names and their scores, write a function that returns the name of the student with the highest score.
Example: Input: {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 90, "Charlie": 92} Output: "Charlie"
14. Apply Lambda to List
Problem: Write a function that takes a list of integers and a lambda function, and returns a new list where the lambda function is applied to each element of the list.
Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], Lambda: lambda x: x ** 2 Output: [1, 4, 9, 16] Explanation: Each number is squared by the lambda function. Mahnoor Salman

15. Sum or Multiply Based on Keyword Argument
Problem: Write a function that takes a variable-length list of numbers (*args) and an optional keyword argument operation. If operation='multiply', return the product of all the numbers; otherwise, return their sum.
Example: Input: (1, 2, 3, 4), operation='multiply' Output: 24 Explanation: The product of the numbers 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 is 24.
